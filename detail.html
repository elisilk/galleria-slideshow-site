                  Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van
                  Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state
                  that the picture was painted from memory. The view has been
                  identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a
                  view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than
                  twenty-one times, including The Starry Night. "Through the
                  iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23
                  May 1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above
                  which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."

                  The painting is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description
                  of a 'head' that was not meant to be a portrait. It depicts a
                  European girl wearing an exotic dress, an oriental turban, and
                  what was thought to be a very large pearl as an earring. In
                  2014, Dutch astrophysicist Vincent Icke raised doubts about
                  the material of the earring and argued that it looks more like
                  polished tin than pearl on the grounds of the specular
                  reflection, the pear shape and the large size of the earring.

                  The scene occurs within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed
                  bull stands over a grieving woman holding a dead child in her
                  arms. In the center of the room a horse falls in agony with a
                  large gaping hole in its side, as if it had just been run
                  through by a spear or javelin. The horse appears to be wearing
                  chain mail armor, decorated with vertical tally marks arranged
                  in rows. A dead and dismembered soldier lies under the horse.
                  The hand of his severed right arm grasps a shattered sword,
                  from which a flower grows.

                  Penitent Magdalene is a painting by the Italian artist
                  Artemisia Gentileschi. It hangs in Seville Cathedral. It has
                  probably been in the cathedral since the late 17th century.
                  The painting's first home was the collection of Fernando
                  Enriquez Afan de Ribera, from 1626 to 1637. She returned to
                  the subject later in the 1620s in Mary Magdalene as
                  Melancholy.

                  The painting, in vertical format, shows a close-up view of
                  Christ's disciples struggling frantically against the heavy
                  storm to regain control of their fishing boat. A huge wave
                  beats the bow and rips the sail. One of the disciples is seen
                  vomiting over the side. Another one, looking directly out at
                  the viewer, is a self-portrait of the artist. Only Christ,
                  depicted on the right, remains calm.

                  The Great Wave off Kanagawa (Japanese: 神奈川沖浪裏, Hepburn:
                  Kanagawa-oki Nami Ura, lit. "Under the Wave off Kanagawa"),
                  also known as The Great Wave or simply The Wave, is a
                  woodblock print by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai. It was
                  published sometime between 1829 and 1833 in the late Edo
                  period as the first print in Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views
                  of Mount Fuji. The image depicts an enormous wave threatening
                  three boats off the coast in the Sagami Bay (Kanagawa
                  Prefecture) while Mount Fuji rises in the background.

                  This self-portrait was one of about 32 produced over a 10-year
                  period, and these were an important part of his work as a
                  painter; he painted himself because he often lacked the money
                  to pay for models. He took the painting with him to
                  Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr. Paul
                  Gachet, who thought it was "absolutely fanatical". Art
                  historians are divided as to whether this painting or
                  Self-portrait without beard is Van Gogh's final self-portrait.
                  The art historians Ingo F. Walther and Jan Hulsker consider
                  this to be the last.

                  The Sleeping Gypsy (French: La Bohémienne endormie) is an 1897
                  oil painting by French Naïve artist Henri Rousseau
                  (1844–1910). It is a fantastical depiction of a lion musing
                  over a sleeping woman on a moonlit night. Rousseau first
                  exhibited the painting at the 13th Salon des Indépendants, and
                  tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the mayor of his hometown,
                  Laval. Instead, it entered the private collection of a
                  Parisian charcoal merchant where it remained until 1924, when
                  it was discovered by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles.

                  kon lermelˈliːno]; Polish: Dama z gronostajem) is a portrait
                  painting widely attributed to the Italian Renaissance artist
                  Leonardo da Vinci. Dated to c. 1489–1491, the work is painted
                  in oils on a panel of walnut wood. Its subject is Cecilia
                  Gallerani, a mistress of Ludovico Sforza ("Il Moro"), Duke of
                  Milan; Leonardo was painter to the Sforza court at the time of
                  its execution. It is one of only four surviving portraits of
                  women painted by Leonardo, the others being Ginevra de' Benci,
                  La Belle Ferronnière and the Mona Lisa.

                  The Night Café (French: Le Café de nuit) is an oil painting
                  created by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh in September 1888 in
                  Arles. Its title is inscribed lower right beneath the
                  signature. The painting is owned by Yale University and is
                  currently held at the Yale University Art Gallery in New
                  Haven, Connecticut. The interior depicted is the Café de la
                  Gare, 30 Place Lamartine, run by Joseph-Michel Ginoux and his
                  wife Marie, who in November 1888 posed for Van Gogh's and
                  Gauguin's Arlésienne; a bit later, Joseph Ginoux evidently
                  posed for both artists, too.

                  The Basket of Apples (French: Le panier de pommes) is a still
                  life oil painting by French artist Paul Cézanne, which he
                  created c. 1893. The painting is particularly remarkable for
                  its creative composition, which rejected realistic
                  representation in favour of distorting objects to create
                  multiple perspectives. This approach eventually influenced
                  other art movements, including Fauvism and Cubism. It belongs
                  to the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection of the Art
                  Institute of Chicago.

                  Cézanne painted four oil portraits of this Italian boy in the
                  red vest, all in different poses, which allowed him to study
                  the relationship between the figure and space. The most famous
                  of the four, and the one commonly referred to by this title,
                  is the one which depicts the boy in a melancholic seated pose
                  with his elbow on a table and his head cradled in his hand. It
                  is currently held in Zürich, Switzerland. The other three
                  portraits, of different poses, are in museums in the US.

                  It is considered one of the most original and complex
                  paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex
                  iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion
                  of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to
                  Ernst Gombrich "in its own way it was as new and revolutionary
                  as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of
                  the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by
                  magic ... For the first time in history the artist became the
                  perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term".

                  The Mona Lisa (/ˌmoʊnə ˈliːsə/; italian: La Gioconda [la
                  dʒoˈkonda] or Monna Lisa [ˈmɔnna ˈliːza]) is a half-length
                  portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.
                  Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian
                  Renaissance, it has been described as "the best known, the
                  most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the
                  most parodied work of art in the world". The painting's novel
                  qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, the
                  monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of
                  forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.

                  The painting depicts an elegant young woman on a swing. A
                  smiling young man, hiding in the bushes on the left, watches
                  her from a vantage point that allows him to see up into her
                  billowing dress, where his arm is pointed with hat in hand. A
                  smiling older man, who is nearly hidden in the shadows on the
                  right, propels the swing with a pair of ropes. The older man
                  appears to be unaware of the young man. As the young lady
                  swings high, she throws her left leg up, allowing her dainty
                  shoe to fly through the air.
