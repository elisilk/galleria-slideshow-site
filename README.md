## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slideshow and view each painting in a lightbox

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility

### What I learned

As always, so many cool :sunglasses: things. Here are some of the key resources I used:

- Masonry layout - So much to include here.
  - [Approaches for a CSS Masonry Layout](https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout/) - As typical for me, I look for a CSS-first approach to start and build in the JavaScript only as needed. CSS-Tricks and Chris Coyier is always a great place to start, and he didn't disappoint with this list of resources for masonry layouts.

### Continued development

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- [ ] The block padding end for the main slider `div` section of the detail pages should be lowered (from 40px down to 25px) in the tablet view. This is most evident looking at the slides with more content (e.g., The Great Wave off Kanagawa or Van Gogh self-portrait). Is also evident when using the 768x1280 viewport from the Figma design, and in that case there is currently a vertical scroll (which shouldn't be there). Will have to resolve that the block padding is currently set using a utility class `.block-margin-normal`, but that may need to be overridden for the details page or for the `.slider__slides` div, so that the start and end padding are differentiated in that case.
- [ ] The design seems to have a more compact ordering for the masonry layout on the homepage than would occur if just using the "min" algorithm to order the elements. Should I just hardcode the ordering for this particular design? Or figure out a fancier algorithm that seeks to balance the column heights?
- [ ] The thumbnail images seems to always be 100% of their intrinsic height, and then are possibly centered and clipped in the inline axis. But that is problematic for my masonry implementation, that pretty much assumes the items will be 100% of the column width. I think an approach I'd like to try is to have an optional parameter to the masonry implementation of the max column width. In the event that the column width exceeds that max AND there is not enough space to add a new column, the masonry flex container should not go beyond that max width and so will have extra inline space. That inline space can either be used to center the masonry container or could be put to one side or the other.

More general ideas I want to consider:

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - He's the best.
- [Accessibility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/)
- [MDN Web Docs for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Went here a lot to reference the different CSS properties and the shorthands, and all the great explanations about best practices.
- [The Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - Used for all of fluid typography and fluid spacing calculations. I didn't end up using it in this solution, but it's always there when I need it.
